## Overview

This [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) [Lovelace Dashboard](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards) Card supports the use of Javascript templates to dynamically configure other nested Dashboard Cards.

### Template Language

Note that this Card uses **Javascript** templates. It does NOT support the **Jinja2** templates that are used elsewhere in Home Assistant.

This is because Dashboard Cards are normally rendered entirely in the web browser using Javascript, while Jinja2 templates must be rendered by Python on the Home Assistant server. The use of Javascript for templates enables this Card to render templates entirely in the browser without deviating from the expected design pattern of Dashboard Cards.

For an alternative Card that does support Jinja2 templates, see [lovelace-card-templater](https://github.com/gadgetchnnel/lovelace-card-templater). That Card works by making API calls from the browser to the Home Assistant server to render each template.

### Minimum Home Assistant Version

Home Assistant version 0.110.0 or higher is required as of release 1.2.0 of config-template-card.

### Support

Hey dude! Help me out for a couple of :beers: or a :coffee:!

## Installation

Use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) or follow this [guide](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-config/wiki/Lovelace-Plugins)

## Configuration

(If you are new to config-template-card, you may want to skim the [Examples](#Examples) first, then return to this section for more details.)

config-template-card must be configured using YAML, either in the UI code editor or in a [YAML dashboard](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/dashboards/#adding-more-dashboards-with-yaml).  The following YAML options are available.

| Name            | Type        | Requirement  | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| type            | string      | **Required** | Must be `custom:config-template-card`             |
| entities        | list        | **Optional** | List of entity strings that should be watched for updates. If not specified then templates will not be re-evaluated when entities are updated. |
| staticVariables | list/object | **Optional** | List of variables which can be used in templates and indexed using `svars` or by name. These are evaluated only on the first update/render and are preserved without re-evaluation for subsequent updates. |
| variables       | list/object | **Optional** | List of variables which that can be used in templates and indexed using `vars` or by name. These are evaluated on each update/render. |
| card            | object      | **Optional** | Nested Card configuration.                        |
| row             | object      | **Optional** | Nested Row configuration.                         |
| element         | object      | **Optional** | Nested Element configuration.                     |
| style           | object      | **Optional** | Nested Element Style configuration. Can only be used with `element`. |

Exactly one of `card`, `row`, or `element` is required.

### Templates

Values used or nested anywhere in the above YAML options may contain Javascript templates surrounded by `<$` and `$>` delimiters.

If a YAML value consists of a single template with no surrounding text, then the template Javascript may return a string, number, array, or object (all values in the array or object must also be one of those types, and all object keys must be strings or numbers), and the returned value will be inserted directly into the generated data structure.

If a YAML value contains multiple templates or has surrounding text, then the return value of the template Javascript will be converted to a string and substituted into the YAML value.

Templates cannot be used in keys of nested objects in YAML, however a template may be used to generate a nested object with dynamic keys.

YAML values that begin with `$! ` (`$!` followed by a space) will not be parsed for templates.  `$! ` will be removed from the beginning of the value in the generated data structure, but any `<$ ... $>` sequences within the value will be left as-is.

For backward compatibility with earlier versions of config-template-card, top-level (not nested) values in `staticVariables` and `variables` which do not begin with `$! ` and do not include any `<$ ... $>` sequences will be evaluated as if the entire value were a template. (All other YAML values are evaluated only if they include a `<$ ... $>` sequence.) Use `$! ` to disable this behavior. Reliance on this behavior is discouraged, and this behavior may be removed in a future version, so `<$ ... $>` should be used in any variable value that should be evaluated as a template.

Also for backward compatibility, `${` and `}` delimiters may be used instead of `<$` and `$>` in a YAML value that consists of a single template with no surrounding text. Reliance on this behavior is also discouraged, and this behavior may be removed in a future version, so `${` and `}` should be replaced with `<$` and '$>` in old configs.

### YAML Interactions

Templates are parsed as YAML strings before being evaluated as Javascript code.

See [YAML Multiline Strings](https://yaml-multiline.info/) for details on YAML string parsing.

To minimize the likelihood of unexpected parsing behavior or interactions, the following conventions are recommended for all YAML values that contain templates or complex strings:

* For single-line values that do not contain any `'` (single quote) characters, surround the value with single quotes.
* For multi-line values, or single-line values that contain any `'` (single quote) characters, use "literal block style" (`key: |-`).

Note that YAML parses unquoted numbers as numbers, but parses numbers in quotes or "block style" as strings.  This distinction may be important in some cases.

Reasoning:

* "Plain" (unquoted) YAML strings should be avoided due to special YAML handling of some character sequences like `: ` (colon space) that might be used in templates or complex strings.
* Double-quoted YAML strings should be avoided due to YAML parsing of escape sequences like `\n` (newline) that might be used in templates.
* Single-quoted YAML strings should be avoided for values that contain any `'` (single quote) characters to avoid hard-to-read escape sequences for those characters.
* "Folded block style" (`key: >-`) should be avoided because the removal of interspersed newline characters could potentially change the semantics of some Javascript code in templates.
* Any block style chomping indicator (`-`, `+`, or none) may be used, however since templates and strings for config-template-card are unlikely to be affected by or have any use for trailing newlines, they should be stripped by default (using `-`).

### Template variables

The following Javascript variables may be used in templates.

| Variable    | Description                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hass`      | The [hass](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/data/) object.       |
| `states`    | The [states](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/data/#hassstates) object. |
| `user`      | The [user](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/data/#hassuser) object. |
| `config`    | The configuration provided to config-template-card. This is read-only, includes the unevaluated templates, and does not include any dashboard-wide `config_template_card_staticVars` or `config_template_card_vars` values. |
| `svars`     | Defined by `staticVariables` configuration and accessible in your templates to avoid redundant expensive operations. If `staticVariables` in the configuration is a yaml list, then `svars` is an array starting with index 0. If `staticVariables` in the configuration is an object, then `svars` is a string-indexed map and you can also access the variables by name without using `svars` at all. |
| `vars`      | Defined by `variables` configuration and accessible in your templates to help clean them up. If `variables` in the configuration is a yaml list, then `vars` is an array starting with index 0. If `variables` in the configuration is an object, then `vars` is a string-indexed map and you can also access the variables by name without using `vars` at all. |
| `output`    | While evaluating the `card`, `row`, or `element` configuration, `output` contains the partially assembled/evaluated copy of that config section. This may be used, for example, to reference a nested card's `type` or `entities` in a template for that card's `name` without requiring the referenced values to be defined in `variables`. |

Templates may define additional Javascript variables, but they will be local to the template.

## Examples

### General example

```yaml
type: custom:config-template-card
variables:
  LIGHT_ENTITY: '$! light.bed_light'
  LIGHT_STATE: '<$ states[LIGHT_ENTITY].state $>'
  GARAGE_STATE: '<$ states["cover.garage_door"].state $>'
entities:
  - '<$ LIGHT_ENTITY $>'
  - cover.garage_door
  - alarm_control_panel.alarm
  - climate.ecobee
card:
  type: '<$ LIGHT_STATE === "on" ? "glance" : "entities" $>'
  entities:
    - entity: '<$ LIGHT_STATE === "on" ? LIGHT_ENTITY : "climate.ecobee" $>'
      icon: |-
        <$ GARAGE_STATE === 'open' ? 'mdi:hotel' : '' $>
    - entity: cover.garage_door
    - entity: alarm_control_panel.alarm
      name: |-
        <$
        (function() {
          if (GARAGE_STATE === 'open' && states['alarm_control_panel.alarm'].state === 'armed_home') {
            return 'Close the garage!';
          }
          return '';
        })();
        $>
    - entity: climate.ecobee
      name: '<$ states["climate.ecobee"].attributes.current_temperature > 22 ? "Cozy" : "Too Hot/Cold" $>'
```

Notes:
TODO

### Templated entities example

```yaml
type: custom:config-template-card
variables:
  - states['sensor.light']
entities:
  - '${vars[0].entity_id}'
card:
  type: light
  entity: '${vars[0].entity_id}'
  name: "${vars[0].state === 'on' ? 'Light On' : 'Light Off'}"
```

### Picture-elements card example

```yaml
type: picture-elements
image: http://hs.sbcounty.gov/CN/Photo%20Gallery/_t/Sample%20Picture%20-%20Koala_jpg.jpg?Mobile=0
elements:
  - type: custom:config-template-card
    variables:
      - states['light.bed_light'].state
    entities:
      - light.bed_light
      - sensor.light_icon_color
    element:
      type: icon
      icon: "${vars[0] === 'on' ? 'mdi:home' : 'mdi:circle'}"
      style:
        '--paper-item-icon-color': "${ states['sensor.light_icon_color'].state }"
    style:
      top: 47%
      left: 75%
```

The `style` object on the element configuration is applied to the element itself, the `style` object on the `config-template-card` is applied to the surrounding card. Both can contain templated values. For example, in order to place the card properly, the `top` and `left` attributes must always be configured on the `config-template-card`.

### Entities card example

```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - type: custom:config-template-card
    variables:
      - states['light.bed_light'].state
    entities:
      - light.bed_light
    row:
      type: section
      label: "${vars[0] === 'on' ? 'Light On' : 'Light Off'}"
  - entity: light.bed_light
```

### Markdown card example

```yaml
type: custom:config-template-card
entities:
  - sensor.outside_temperature
  - sensor.time
  - weather.home
variables:
  weather: |
    () => {
        let hass = document.querySelector("home-assistant").hass;
        let w = states['weather.home'].state;
        let key = 'component.weather.state._.' + w;
        return hass.resources[hass.language][key];
      }
  card:
    type: markdown
    content: |
      ### {{ states('sensor.outside_temperature') }} ¬∞C - ${weather()}
      # {{ states('sensor.time') }}
```

### Defining functions in variables

If you find yourself having to rewrite the same logic in multiple locations, you can define methods inside Config Template Card's variables, which can be called anywhere within the scope of the card:

```yaml
type: custom:config-template-card
variables:
  setTempMessage: |
    (prefix, temp) => {
      if (temp <= 19) {
          return prefix + 'Quick, get a blanket!';
      }
      else if (temp >= 20 && temp <= 22) {
        return prefix + 'Cozy!';
      }
      return prefix + 'It's getting hot in here...';
    }
  currentTemp: states['climate.ecobee'].attributes.current_temperature
entities:
  - climate.ecobee
card:
  type: entities
  entities:
    - entity: climate.ecobee
      name: '${ setTempMessage("House: ", currentTemp) }'
```

### Asynchronous functions

Asynchronous functions can be used in most templates.

```yaml
type: custom:config-template-card
entities:
  - light.bed_light
  - light.porch_light
card:
  type: entities
  entities:
    - entity: light.bed_light
      name: "${(async () => states['light.bed_light'].state === 'on' ? 'Bed Light On' : 'Bed Light Off' )();}"
    - entity: light.porch_light
      name: "${(async () => { return states['light.bed_light'].state === 'on' ? 'Porch Light On' : 'Porch Light Off'; })();}"
```

Card rendering will be delayed until all asynchronous functions (in all templates) have completed, so long-running asynchronous functions may prevent the card from rendering on page load or delay updates to the card.

When defining `staticVariables` that reference other (previously defined) `svars`, any referenced `svars` that use asynchronous functions will contain the unsettled `Promise` object.

Similarly, when defining `variables` that reference other (previously defined) `vars`, any referenced `vars` that use asynchronous functions will contain the unsettled `Promise` object. However, any referenced `svars` that use asynchronous functions will contain complete/settled values.

Also similarly, when evaluating the `card`, `row`, or `element` configuration, any `output` values that use asynchronous functions will contain the unsettled `Promise` object.  However, any referenced `svars` or `vars` that use asynchronous functions will contain complete/settled values.

When defining `entities` that use templates, any `entities` templates that use asynchronous functions will be skipped, and any referenced `vars` that use asynchronous functions will contain the unsettled `Promise` object, which will not settle before `entities` is used. However, any referenced `svars` that use asynchronous functions will have complete/settled values.

(The reason that asynchronous functions cannot be used for `entities` is that Lit does not support asynchronous functions in `shouldUpdate()` where `entities` is evaluated and used.  The alternative [lovelace-card-templater](https://github.com/gadgetchnnel/lovelace-card-templater) cannot support templates in its `entities` for the same reason; it uses API calls to render templates, and API calls require the use of asynchronous functions.)

### Dashboard wide variables

If you need to use the same variable in multiple cards, then instead of defining it in each card's `variables` you can do that once for the entire dashboard.

```yaml
title: My dashboard

config_template_card_staticVars:
  lang: document.documentElement.lang
config_template_card_vars:
  - states['sensor.light'].state

views:
```

Both arrays and objects are supported, just like in card's local variables. It is allowed to mix the two types, i.e. use an array in dashboard variables and an object in card variables, or the other way around. If both definitions are arrays, then dashboard variables are put first in `svars`/`vars`. In the mixed mode, `svars`/`vars` have array indices as well as variable names.

After making changes to these variable definitions in the HA Dashboard Editor, you must reload the browser on any currently-open clients before you will see the changes.  Unlike card config changes which automatically update currently-open clients, dashboard wide variable config changes will not automatically update currently-open clients.
